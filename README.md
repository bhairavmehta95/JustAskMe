## Description

Just Ask Me currently provides a fully anonymous and streamlined ("bare bones") interface to be able to alert a presenter about the topmost questions from the audience. Per our tests, it is fully usable in a university lecture or company meeting settings.

The software is expected to grow to include features like message alert, better message filtering (e.g. question matching) and better message editing and customization (such as the support for LaTeX and computer code). Anonymity and minimal-clicks-to-action will remain the overarching drivers of this project.
